Algorithm Design (Ignore this file for Now)
==========================
==========================



The way this algorithm will function on this site, will be to finding products items based on a few factors:

- Seeking items based on **keywords**

- Seeking items based on **boutiques or fashion houses** 

- Seeking items based on **designers name**

The data the algorithm retrieves will be images(which of course will be product images), those images however will be always linked to a designer by some node of information.

You can thinking of like this:
 
**Product --**Links To**--> Designer**

From this we can begin to compile information from the products that are affiliated with these designers the data, will be used for:

 - Displaying gathered data to see the percentage of the types of clothing a designer sells, for example 

(Designer 1: 45% jeans, 10% accessories, etc), 

(Designer 2: 30% Jeans, 50% Shoes, 20% Tops)

- Displaying gathered data to see the percentage of the types of clothing a designer sells at different boutiques, for example

(Designer 1 at Boutique 1: 45% Jeans, 10% Accessories, 25% Dresses, 20% Tops), (Designer 1 at Boutique 2: 30% Jeans, 50% Shoes, 20% Tops),

(Designer 2 at Boutique 1: 45% Tops, 10% accessories, 25% Dresses, 20% Tops), (Designer 2 at Boutique: 30% Dresses, 50% Tops, 20% Jeans)
