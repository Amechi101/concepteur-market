##Notes:

Legend for ‘Development Status’:

‘In-Process’ (Meaning currently being work on towards completion)
‘Not Started’ 
‘Completed’  (Read for testing, in which you switch “Ready For Testing on excel to “Yes”)
‘In-Process/Query’ (Meaning currently being work on towards completion but encountering a few problems in development. This must be taken care off first before continuing on to a new section

Use the numbering in the "##Legned for Main Area's of the website:" and specifically for profile area (number and subsequent letter) to address what is currently being worked on.


#Other Important things:

When writing within the ##development notes you place any comment you need to create by starting (‘Your name’ Start) & end it with (‘Your name’ End), in the color code of that section. Place the your comments within the tags you create with the guideline I just gave you and keep adding anything you need to say or want to be heard within those tags. Also when you inputting comments place them in between the tag (‘The current date of that day’ start) & (‘The current date of that day’  end). I have examples of How I placed my comments right below in the development notes

(9/5/13 start)
I was woking on moodBoard using <canvas> but it seems that when putting multiple images into a single canvas, its hard to associate drag&drop event to each element. But if I use multiple canvas, its hard to use DataURL to save it. So I switched to Kinetic JS.

(9/9/2013 start)
I am working on the saved looks and looks feed, which is almost done. However, I am experiencing a bit of difficulty with changing the color about a 
fixed shade because I need to come up with a algorithm or find one online. 
(9/9/2013 end)

(9/15/2013 START)
I finished rendering and saving the model from the saved looks to the looks feed (excluding embedding it into an HTML file; right now it is pure flash) 
(9/15/2013 END)
