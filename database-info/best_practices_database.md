- Entity Comments is a week entity as it doesnt have its own primary key and it is totally dependent on the entity Product and Users.

- Entity boutiques and entity product has a many to many relationship and when there is a many to many relationship between two entities, 
relationship set Pro_bou will be formed into a new table consisting primary keys of both the entity.
