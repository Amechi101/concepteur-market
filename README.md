Concepteur-Market
=================
I've added a few files:
- `concepteur_market.sql` is the file I used to create the database. If everything somehow crashes on Google, we can use that file to recreate the database. Much easier than 23 separate files.
- `.gitignore` is a file that tells git to ignore certain files (fancy that!) At the moment, all we're telling it to ignore is a certain OS X system file, but in the future we'll want to ignore any sort of compiled files we might create.
