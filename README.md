Project Overview
================
The main goal of the application is to build an open resource for users to find the latest and greatest independent designers. Users will have an array of merchandise/designers to search from being able to research product information, location of products, trending items within the platform and etc. Users that sign-up however will have additional features such as liking & commenting on products, adding products to a personal feed, getting notifications and altering any information we have available (Pending Review and or/influnce level on the platform). 

Designers will have their own access portal to upload information, which is a separate login (from users), to upload their own product information onto the platform(The Designer Login is a key component to the application).

We will of course have an access portal as well to upload information, approve any changes to product information or govern the application. (Master Access if you will)

The application is comparable to Pinterest, Wikipedia and Linkedin. Not in totality but to subtle features within each platform respectively.

- For now we will focus only on New York independent designers in the metropolitain area.

- New Name for the project is: 'Indieitude'
